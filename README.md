### :bulb: Description
This project presents an end-to-end solution to the 2024 Diabetes Datathon. The solution covers data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as Exploratory Data Analysis and advanced statistical analyses. The solution aims to provide a refined and insightful dataset which can be leveraged for robust medical analysis and study.

### :briefcase: Datathon Brief
Diabetes is a complex, chronic endocrine disorder, affecting millions of British people per year. November is Diabetes Awareness month, and your client - a drug manufacturer, has just secured funding to break ground in a new product segment for Diabetes. In preparation to launch the novel product, and in honour of Diabetes awareness month, they want you to analyse the impact of the disease on the human body.

They have hired you, a team of Data Analysts, to spend the 2 weeks of the Datathon performing data analysis and visualisation, to inform their approach.
